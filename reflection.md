## Advice I would give myself
- I would have told myself to start off with something a little simpler and try to plan things out better before just going straight into writing the code.
## need to have list
- I did finish everything in my need to have list although I feel like I might have been able to add a little bit more.
## hardest part
- The hardest part of my project was trying to get it all done within a few days as i did choose to move on which i think was the right decision but it took a lot of hours to get everything done.
## problem I couldn't solve
- I wasn't able to create movement in the original idea which forced me to try a new project but that will probably go unsolved for awhile.
